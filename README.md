# Cache_Performance_Analysis
Cache performance analysis for different sort algorithms using PAPI library in C, Spring 2020

•	Analyzed the behavior of different sorting algorithms for input array with different sizes by providing the data cache performance parameters, branch misprediction rate and execution time measurements

•	Instrumented the code to use PAPI (Performance API) hardware performance counters to determine the behavior of each sort algorithm separately

•	Skills used: C, PAPI, Valgrind tool, gprof tool

This project was submitted as part of the Advanced Computer Architecture course taught by Professor Edgar Gabriel at the University of Houston Spring 2020
